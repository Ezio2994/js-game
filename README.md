## Initial Fantasy

I built this game having in mind the old fashioned turn based rpg games therefore I called it Initial Fantasy inspired from one of the greatest fantasy media franchise ever, Final Fantasy.
The game is fully built in vanilla JavaScript with a functional programming approach.

### Main Features

Once the user start the game is going to receive a tutorial accesable every moment during the game from the menu.
During battle character can "attack", use "magic" which inflict more damage to different type of enemies, using "items" to restore MP/AP and "flee" to try escape the battle.
By defeating enemies the character is going to get experience point which can be used to increase the character's stats and become stronger.
By defeting enemenies the character may randomly gain item usable to restore LP (life point) and AP (art point).
By defeting enemenies the character may randomly gain Equipment which once worn increase character's stats.
